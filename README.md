# Delete My Origins!

This datapack can remove internal origins in the Origins Mod.

There are two versions of datapack:

- Named with `All` will remove all origins.

- Named with `Human` will keep the human origin.

**Note: 1.Since a datapack cannot have multiple version number, loading may have warnings. Just ignore them.**

**2.These origins can still obtain with command.**
